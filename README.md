# POLS0012 — Causal Analysis (Year 2)

This repository contains my work for the **POLS0012: Causal Analysis** module.  
The module develops practical and conceptual understanding of **causal inference**, combining applied R coding exercises with original research design.

## Part 1 — Quantitative Analysis (Coding Questions)

In Part 1, I completed two applied causal inference tasks implemented in **R Markdown**:

1. **Replication Task:**  
   Reproduced and extended results from *Nathan Nunn (2008), “The Long-Term Effects of Africa’s Slave Trades,”* using instrumental variable estimation and additional variables provided by the instructor.

2. **Simulated Experiment:**  
   Analysed a generated dataset with 100 observations and six variables to explore causal identification under controlled, simulated conditions.

## Part 2 — Research Design Essay

In Part 2, I designed an original research proposal titled:  
**“Does Sex Education Reduce Students’ Attitudes of Rape Culture?”**

This project demonstrates understanding of causal reasoning, research design, and identification strategies in social science.  
It received a **First Class grade**, reflecting:
- Originality in causal question framing  
- Clear operationalisation of variables and outcomes  
- Realistic and methodologically sound design  
- Excellent clarity and structure in presentation
